Steps of compiling BigDataBench Spark programs:

1. Make sure Scala has been installed in your environment. The recommened scala version is 2.10.x.
 Refer to: http://www.scala-lang.org/download/

2. You need to install the sbt tool first. Refer to: http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html

3. Use sbt to compile and package. Use the following commands:
    sbt compile
    sbt package
The bigdatabench-spark_2.10-1.3.0.jar file will be found under the target/scala-2.10/ directory. You can copy this file to a node with Spark-x.y.z (should be same as the spark-core version specified in the build.sbt file and can be other versions.) and submit it to the Spark cluster. For further details please refer to: http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
