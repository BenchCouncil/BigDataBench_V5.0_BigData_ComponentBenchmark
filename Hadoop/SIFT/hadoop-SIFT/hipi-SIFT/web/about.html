      <div class="section">
	HIPI is designed to provide a clean and simple interface for performing efficient and high-throughput image processing within the Apache Hadoop MapReduce framework. HIPI was created by Sean Arietta, Jason Lawrence, Liu Liu, and Chris Sweeney working together at the <a class="external_link" href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~gfx/">University of Virginia Computer Graphics Lab</a>. HIPI has been used in a number of projects and even gained some <a class="external_link" href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/12/how-to-analyze-100-million-images-for-624.html">press</a>.<br/ ><br />

	  The initial development of HIPI was supported in part by the National Science Foundation through a Cluster Exploratory (CluE) grant IIS-0844416 ("Image Super-Resolution using Trillions of Examples") and with resources generously made available by IBM and Google.
