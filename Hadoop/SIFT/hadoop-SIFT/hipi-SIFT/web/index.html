      <h2 class="title">Overview</h2>

      <div class="section">

        HIPI is an image processing library designed to be used with the <a class="external_link" href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Apache Hadoop MapReduce</a> parallel programming framework. HIPI facilitates efficient and high-throughput image processing with MapReduce style parallel programs typically executed on a cluster. It provides a solution for how to store a large collection of images on the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and make them available for efficient distributed processing. HIPI also provides integration with <a class="external_link" href="http://opencv.org">OpenCV</a>, a popular open-source library that contains many computer vision algorithms (see <a href="examples/pca.html">covar example program</a> to learn more about this integration).<br /><br />

HIPI is developed and maintained by a growing number of developers from around the world.<br /><br />The latest release of HIPI has been tested with Hadoop 2.7.1.<br/><br/>

	<h3>System Design</h3>

      This diagram shows the organization of a typical MapReduce/HIPI program:<br />
	
	<img class="centered_image" src="images/hipi_pipeline.png" width="700" alt=""/><br />
	
	The primary input object to a HIPI program is a <a href="javadoc/org/hipi/imagebundle/HipiImageBundle.html">HipiImageBundle</a> (HIB). A HIB is a collection of images represented as a single file on the HDFS. The HIPI distribution includes <a href="examples.html">several useful tools</a> for creating HIBs, including a MapReduce program that builds a HIB from a list of images downloaded from the Internet. <br /><br />

	The first processing stage of a HIPI program is a culling step that allows filtering the images in a HIB based on a variety of user-defined conditions like spatial resolution or criteria related to the image metadata. This functionality is achieved through the <a href="javadoc/org/hipi/mapreduce/Culler.html">Culler</a> class. Images that are culled are never fully decoded, saving processing time.<br /><br />

	The images that survive the culling stage are assigned to individual map tasks in a way that attempts to maximize data locality, a cornerstone of the Hadoop MapReduce programming model. This functionality is achieved through the <a href="javadoc/org/hipi/imagebundle/mapreduce/HibInputFormat.html">HibInputFormat</a> class. Finally, individual images are presented to the Mapper as objects derived from the <a href="javadoc/org/hipi/image/HipiImage.html">HipiImage</a> abstract base class along with an associated <a href="javadoc/org/hipi/image/HipiImageHeader.html">HipiImageHeader</a> object. For example, the <a href="javadoc/org/hipi/image/ByteImage.html">ByteImage</a> and <a href="javadoc/org/hipi/image/FloatImage.html">FloatImage</a> classes extend the HipiImage base class and provide access to the underlying raster grid of image pixel values as arrays of Java bytes and floats, respectively. These classes provide a number of useful functions like cropping, color space conversion, and scaling.<br /><br />

	HIPI also includes support for <a class="external_link" href="http://opencv.org">OpenCV</a>, a popular open-source computer vision library. Specifically, image classes that extend from RasterImage (such as ByteImage and FloatImage, discussed above) may be converted to <a class="external_link" href="http://bytedeco.org/javacpp-presets/opencv/apidocs/org/bytedeco/javacpp/opencv_core.Mat.html">OpenCV Java Mat</a> objects using routines in the <a href="javadoc/org/hipi/opencv/OpenCVUtils.html">OpenCVUtils</a> class. The <a href="javadoc/org/hipi/opencv/OpenCVMatWritable.html">OpenCVMatWritable</a> class provides a wrapper around the OpenCV Java Mat class that can be used as a key or value object in MapReduce programs. See the <a href="examples/pca.html">covar example program</a> for more detailed information about how to use HIPI with OpenCV.<br /><br />

	The records emitted by the Mapper are collected and transmitted to the Reducer according to the built-in MapReduce shuffle algorithm that attemps to minimize network traffic. Finally, the user-defined reduce tasks are executed in parallel and their output is aggregated and written to the HDFS.<br /><br />

<!--
	The goal of HIPI is to provide a simple and clean interface for high-throughput distributed image processing on the MapReduce platform. To this end, we performed a series of <a href="experiments.html">experiments</a> that show HIPI favorably compares to several common alternatives for representing and processing large collections of binary data in MapReduce.
